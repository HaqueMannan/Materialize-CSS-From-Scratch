Section 3.5 Tables & Media:

--------------------------------------
Tables & Media
--------------------------------------
- Materialize will provide a default style for tables which require no classes to your HTML elements, however we can use the class of striped to give your tables a stripe style of white and light grey rows.
   <table class="stripe">
      ...
   </table>

- We can add the class bordered to give a line underneath each row; a class of highlight which will highlight light grey when we hover over a row; and a class of responsive-table which will change the orientation of the table from a vertical to a horizontal table when the screen size changes.
   <table class="bordered highlight responsive-table">
      ...
   </table>

- To make a image responsive in size i.e. fit within its container regardless of the screen size we must give it a class of responsive-img else the image will not fit within the screen and will go outside its container even if you used the grid system.
   <div class="row">
      <div class="col s6">
         <img src="img/img1.jpeg" alt="" class="responsive-img">
      </div>
   </div>

- We can make circular images by using the class of circle
   <img src="img/img1.jpeg" alt="" class="responsive-img circle">

- We can create a responsive-video (whether the video is embedded or local) to fit within its container and not go across the screen by wrapping the embedded video within a <div> element with the class of video-container:
Embedded Video
   <div class="video-container">
      <iframe width="835" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/videoRef" frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe>
   </div>

Video from Local Folder
   <div class="video-container">
      <source src="somevideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   </div>
